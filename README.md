# SDGO Translation
Project to translate UI to English in SDGO for Seal server: https://sauceburnseal.net/#!index.md

# Contributing
To contribute to the project, create a fork of this repository and edit the file `lang-zh_EN.json`, translating any number of strings to English. Then, submit a pull request to the `master` branch of this repository to get your changes merged in.

When editing strings, leave special characters like `%s`, `%d`, and `%02d` as they are, as these are placeholders that are used to fill strings dynamically in-game.

The file `lang-zh_CN.json` exists as a reference for the original text, and should not be edited.
